Description: Extended (but compatible) fork of ttyrec
 ttyrec is a terminal (tty) recorder, it comes with ttyplay, which is a tty player.
 Some features ov ovh-ttyrec follow:
 -   Drop-in replacement of the classic ttyrec, additional features don't break compatibility
 -   The code is portable and OS features that can be used are detected at compile time
 -   Supports ttyrec output file rotation without interrupting the session
 -   Supports locking the session after a keyboard input timeout, optionally displaying a custom message
 -   Supports terminating the session after a keyboard input timeout
 -   Supports manually locking or terminating the session via "cheatcodes" (specific keystrokes)
 -   Supports a no-tty mode, relying on pipes instead of pseudottys, while still recording stdout/stderr
 -   Automatically detects whether to use pseudottys or pipes, also overridable from command-line
 -   Supports reporting the number of bytes that were output to the terminal on session exit
